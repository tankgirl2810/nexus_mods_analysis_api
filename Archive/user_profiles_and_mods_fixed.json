      "about": "I solo develop mods as a creative outlet and to gain familiarity with other gaming engines outside of Unreal Engine 5. Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Game Development. I also Forever DM for D\\&D/Pathfinder 2E from time to time.&#x20;\n\nWondering what I'm working on? All modding WIPs get posted on my social media platform accounts. I also keep X(Twitter) and Instagram up-to-date when I release public builds on Nexusmods. I'm also more vocal and responsive on these since I get notifications here.\n\n**➤ Twitter(X):** [DungeonsNSouls](https://twitter.com/DungeonsNSouls)\n\n**➤ Instagram:** [dungeonsandsouls](https://www.instagram.com/dungeonsandsouls/)\n\n**➤ Youtube:** [Dungeons & Souls](https://www.youtube.com/@dungeonsandsouls)\n\n\n\n*Feeling generous and wish to support me for my work, you can donate to my Ko-Fi  down below:*\n\n**➤ Ko-Fi:** [Dungeons and Souls](https://ko-fi.com/dungeonsandsouls)\n\n*Do you want to know what's going on behind the scenes, when mods are finished, and more?
